# Sorting Visualizer

This is a sorting visualization tool that visualizes common sorting algorithms. \\
You can use it yourself [here](https://hk1510.github.io/sorting-visualizer)! \\
I built it with inspiration from [Clement Mihailescu's sorting visualizer](https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/) and added insertion and selection sort along with a comparison counter. \\

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
